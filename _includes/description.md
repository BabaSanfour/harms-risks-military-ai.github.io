I am a PhD student at the University of Osnabrück and [EyeQuant](https://eyequant.com) with [Prof. Peter König](https://portal.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/~NBP/PeterKoenig.html), as a fellow of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie ITN [NexGenVis](https://www.nextgenvis.eu). I obtained my B.Sc and M.Sc. at the University Carlos III of Madrid and I have been a visiting PhD student at the University of Cambridge with [Dr. Tim Kietzmann](http://www.timkietzmann.de/) and at the Spinoza Center for Neuroimaging with [Dr Serge Dumoulin](http://www.spinozacentre.nl/dumoulin/).

My main research focus is on brain-inspired deep learning and computational neuroscience. I believe that machine learning and neuroscience can highly benefit each other and my aim is exploring and exploiting these interactions.
