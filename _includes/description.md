I have recently submitted the [dissertation]({{ site.url }}/thesis.pdf) of my PhD, which I have done at the University of Osnabrück and [EyeQuant](https://eyequant.com) with [Prof. Peter König](https://portal.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/~NBP/PeterKoenig.html), as a fellow of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie ITN [NexGenVis](https://www.nextgenvis.eu). I obtained my B.Sc and M.Sc. at the University Carlos III of Madrid and I have been a visiting PhD student at the University of Cambridge with [Dr. Tim Kietzmann](http://www.timkietzmann.de/) and at the Spinoza Center for Neuroimaging with [Dr. Serge Dumoulin](http://www.spinozacentre.nl/dumoulin/).

My main research focus is on brain-inspired deep learning and computational neuroscience. I believe that machine learning and neuroscience can highly benefit each other and my aim is exploring and exploiting these interactions.

Besides my research, I am a strong proponent of Open Science in the broadest sense, and I try to contribute to it with my actions and by getting involved in discussions about how to make science more inclusive, open, reproducible, transparent and have less impact on the environment.
