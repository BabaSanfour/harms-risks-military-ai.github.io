title: Aesthetics and affective assessment of videos through visual descriptors
order: 10
---
This is the project of my [bachelor thesis](https://e-archivo.uc3m.es/handle/10016/24434). We explored the suitability of audiovisual descriptors for predicting subjective aspects of multimedia content, such as the aesthetic value or the elicited emotion and attention.

We labeled several data sets. First, we collected a set of more than 300 car commercials from YouTube and labeled their aesthetic value by using the metadata provided by viewers, such as the likes, dislikes, view count, etc. In other experiments we labeled the elicited [emotion and attention](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3109418) of short movies by measuring the electrodermal activity (skin conductance) of participants while watching the videos.
