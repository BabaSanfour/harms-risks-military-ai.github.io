Since last October I am part of the [Max Planck School of Cognition](https://www.maxplanckschools.de/en/cognition) as a 0-year student. The past two weeks I had the chance to attend the second Cognition Academy, where I met the new PhD students and the rest of mentors of the programme. Not only was it a fun event, but it was also full of fantastic talks and workshops!
