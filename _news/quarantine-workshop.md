It's difficult and sad times for the world. COVID-19 is causing a lot of suffering to many people and keeping most of us at home almost all day. In Spanish we often say the idiom ["to make a virtue out of necessity"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/make%20a%20virtue%20%28out%29%20of%20necessity) to highlight the creativity that arises in the face of adversity. I thought of it after a great day attending a quarantine-induced online workshop on computational neuroscience organised by [Pau Vilimilis Aceituno](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dahpSB8AAAAJ&hl=en#). Great talks, great people, all from home!
