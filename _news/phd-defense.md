A couple of weeks ago, on the 27th of November 2020, I successfully defended my PhD thesis (_summa cum laude_). It was a unique experience to have the chance to discuss my work with several scientists who have inspired my work: [Konrad Kording](http://koerding.com/), [Graham Taylor](https://www.gwtaylor.ca/), [Jeff Bowers](https://jeffbowers.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) and my supervisor [Peter KÃ¶nig](https://portal.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/~NBP/PeterKoenig.html).
