It has been a blast to attend the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) and especially to participate in the workshop ["Should we preregister experiments in computer vision?"](https://preregister.vision/). The talks by the invited speakers and the discussion were really inspiring! It was also great to present our pre-registered paper [Learning representational invariance instead of categorization](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/html/PreReg/Hernandez-Garcia_Learning_Representational_Invariance_Instead_of_Categorization_ICCVW_2019_paper.html).
