It's been my pleasure to give a talk at [Radoslaw M. Cichy's lab.](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/arbeitsbereiche/neural_dyn_of_vis_cog/team_v2/group_leader/rm_cichy/index.html) about some of my work during my PhD, "On the advantages of data augmentation for deep learning and computational neuroscience".

Since I started getting in touch with visual computational neuroscience, I have learnt a lot and got inspiration from some of Radek's papers, so I am very happy to have had the chance to present my work at his lab, [Neural Dynamics of Visual Cognition](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/arbeitsbereiche/neural_dyn_of_vis_cog/index.html), at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, as well as to meet him in person and talk to some of the members of the lab. They do very cool stuff!
