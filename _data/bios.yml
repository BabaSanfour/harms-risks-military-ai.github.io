  bio: 'I am a Master''s student at the University of Montreal, currently doing my
    research at the CHU Sainte-Justine''s research center (LIONlab). At the moment,
    I am studying the development of the brain via neuroimagery in neurotypical infants
    as well as in clinical populations such as premature babies and babies born asphyxiated.
    My research focuses primarily on neuroscience but I am very interested in AI as
    well and most of all, the intersection between the two. '

  bio: I'm a PhD student in Emily Coffey's lab. I'm working on understanding how brain
    state affects sensory representation, exploring the function of sleep spindles,
    and trying to characterize the role of spindle-slow-oscillation coupling in memory
    consolidation across the lifespan.
