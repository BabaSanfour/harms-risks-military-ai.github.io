  bio: I am an Assistant professor at the UC Irvine Department of Cognitive Sciences. I'm also a Cooperating Researcher in the Department of Decoded Neurofeedback at Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International in Kyoto, Japan. Prior to joining UCI I was on the faculty at UC Riverside in the Department of Bioengineering. I received my Ph.D. in computational cognitive neuroscience (psychology) from UCLA and then was a postdoc there as well. My research aims to reveal how the brain represents and uses uncertainty, and performs adaptive computations based on noisy, incomplete information. I specifically focus on how these abilities support metacognitive evaluations of the quality of (mostly perceptual) decisions, and how these processes might relate to phenomenology and conscious awareness. I use neuroimaging, computational modeling, machine learning and neural stimulation techniques to study these topics.

  title: Linking metacognition and consciousness with computational models
  abstract: Few people tackle the neural or computational basis of qualitative experience (Frith, 2019). Why? One major reason is that science and philosophy have both struggled to propose how we might even begin to start studying it. Here I propose that metacognitive computations, and the subjective feelings that go along with them, give us a solid starting point. Specifically, perceptual metacognition possesses unique properties that provide a powerful and unique opportunity for studying the neural and computational correlates of subjective experience. I will describe these properties, and discuss how computational models of metacognition can be used to an empirically-tractable early step in identifying the generative process that constructs qualitative experience, drawing on empirical data. By applying decades of developments in computational cognitive science and formal computational model comparisons to the specific properties of perceptual metacognition, we may reveal new and exciting insights about how the brain constructs subjective conscious experiences and the nature of those experiences themselves.

  bio: "I obtained master degrees in philosophy and psychology, and received my PhD in 1995 at the Free University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Currently I am associate professor (Theoretical Cognitive Science) at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, at the Radboud University Nijmegen. My research focuses on the implications of Cognitive neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence for society and human self-understanding. I investigate the ethical and societal implications of research in, and the ensuing technologies of, CNS and AI, such as Robotics, Brain-Computer Interfacing, and Deep Brain Stimulation. I am particularly interested in the integration of empirical work (i.e. experimentation, computational modeling, and robotics) with philosophical issues regarding knowledge, identity, agency, responsibility and intelligent behavior. I have published in journals such as Nature: Biotechnology, Science and Engineering Ethics, American Journal of Bioethics, Neuroethics, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience and Journal of Social Robotics."

  title: "Unifying AI & Neuroscience: A great idea! But to what purpose?"
  abstract: "The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Neuroscience (NS) has great promise. It can lead to various practical applications in a wide variety of fields, ranging from micro-targeted marketing to clinical therapy and law. At the same time, the combined power of AI and NS leads to serious questions about what it is that we would like to achieve and why. It also leads to questions about how we can exert meaningful human control over the ensuing technologies. This is especially urgent given the many challenges humanity is facing this century, from inequity to ecology. It seems fair to say that our current ways to address these challenges have not been, to put it mildly, particularly successful. AI and NS enable us to see our human strengths and weaknesses with greater clarity, and build more effective technology accordingly. But the potentially exploitative power of this combination of sciences does present us with the challenge to apply it wisely. I will suggest that we are in need of a more profound reflection on what our sciences show us about ourselves, what our technology enables us to do with that, and what, apparently, we aim to do with those insights and applications."

  bio: "Currently doctoral student in clinical psychology, I am particularly interested in ways of fostering awareness, presence, and well-being through the practice of mindfulness. I have been practicing meditation for almost ten years now, in addition to yoga and different breathing techniques, all of which helped me going through anxiety and depression some years ago. As my doctoral thesis, I am now studying the effects of mindfulness practice by therapists on the efficacy of therapy. My hope is to encourage people develop more awareness to their inner world, as well as to find more peace and balance in their life."

  bio: "Aislinn Sandre is a PhD candidate in Clinical Psychology at McGill University. Her research focuses on understanding how stress affects the brain to increase risk for depression and anxiety. Specifically, she examines whether exposure to stress early in life, such as harsh parenting, abuse, neglect, or peer victimization, alters brain responses to rewards and threats, and whether these brain alterations make it more likely that people will develop depression and/or anxiety later on in life. In her work, Aislinn primarily uses electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity during sensitive periods of neurodevelopment, such as infancy, adolescence, and young adulthood. Aislinn has worked as an intern in hospitals and schools in Montreal to provide assessment and psychotherapy for stress- and trauma-related disorders. She has developed and presented several workshops designed to help people reduce stress and improve mental health. Currently, she is training healthcare workers to provide supportive interventions to their colleagues in order to improve coping in response to COVID-19-related stress."
