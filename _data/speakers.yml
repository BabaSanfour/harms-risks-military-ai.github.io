#   title: "AI and Earth observations for global agricultural monitoring and food security"
#   abstract: "Earth-observing satellites are collecting terabytes of observations of the entire planet every day with unprecedented clarity. These globally-available datasets offer immense opportunities for providing time-sensitive information needed by decision-makers about issues important to society, such as agricultural production and food security. Analyzing these petabyte-scale Earth observation datasets requires AI and machine learning methods designed to meet the unique challenges and opportunities of Earth observation data. Harvest is NASA’s applied sciences program on agriculture and food security, committed to advancing the use of satellite Earth observations to benefit food security and agriculture in the US and worldwide. In this talk, Harvest Director Inbal Becker-Reshef and Harvest ML/AI Lead Hannah Kerner will talk about how Harvest is using AI and Earth observations to rapidly respond to critical events impacting global agriculture and food security, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine."

#   title: Machine learning in climate action
#   abstract: Machine learning (ML) can be a useful tool in helping society reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a changing climate. In this talk, we will explore opportunities and challenges in ML for climate action, from optimizing electrical grids to monitoring crop yield, with an emphasis on how to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into machine learning algorithms. We will also consider ways that ML is used in ways that contribute to climate change, and how to better align the use of ML overall with climate goals.
