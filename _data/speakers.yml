  bio: "Recognized worldwide as one of the leading experts in artificial intelligence, Yoshua Bengio is most known for his pioneering work in deep learning, earning him the 2018 A.M. Turing Award, “the Nobel Prize of Computing,” with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun.

  He is a Full Professor at Université de Montréal, and the Founder and Scientific Director of Mila – Quebec AI Institute. He co-directs the CIFAR Learning in Machines & Brains program as Senior Fellow and acts as Scientific Director of IVADO.

  In 2019, he was awarded the prestigious Killam Prize and in 2022, became the computer scientist with the highest h-index in the world. He is a Fellow of both the Royal Society of London and Canada, Knight of the Legion of Honor of France and Officer of the Order of Canada.

  Concerned about the social impact of AI and the objective that AI benefits all, he actively contributed to the Montreal Declaration for the Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence."

  nametitle: Prof.
  position: Professor for AI and Health, Faculty lead for AI at the MIT Jameel Clinic
  bio: "Regina Barzilay is famous for her break-throughs in deep learning for health. She was part of the team who discovered Halicin with deep learning, a new antibiotic compound that kills over 35 powerful bacteria, including AMR tuberculosis, and two of WHO's top-three most deadly bacteria.

  She is professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and the faculty lead for AI at the MIT Jameel clinic, a research center advancing the field of AI health sciences.

  In 2017, Barzilay won the MacArthur Fellowship, known as the “Genius Grant”. Moreover, she became the first recipient of the $1 million AAAI Squirrel AI Award for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity (2020).

  After fighting breast cancer personally in 2014, Barzilay started applying machine learning to oncology, helping with early diagnosis, treatment and disease prevention.
