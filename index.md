# Summary

<img src="{{ site.logo }}" style="width:220px;vertical-align:middle;padding-right:30px;padding-bottom:10px;float:left">
The growing interest of military agencies in adopting AI technologies raises concerns about the harms and risks posed by such AI applications with respect to safety, human rights, marginalized communities, conflict escalations and global security. In this workshop, we aim to bridge the gap between the AI research community and experts in military AI regulations. Our workshop will foster a multidisciplinary discussion about the harms and risks related to the use of AI research advances for military applications. Invited speakers will introduce the audience to the topics of AI arms races, challenges in military AI regulations, implications on human rights, global inequality and global security; as well as strategies for mitigating these harms and risks. We bring together experts from the fields of AI governance, human rights advocacy, humanitarian disarmament, geopolitics and game theory of arms races, as well as researchers who are or were once involved in military applications of AI, to discuss together challenges, potential strategies, and the role of AI researchers in AI militarization and disarmament.
