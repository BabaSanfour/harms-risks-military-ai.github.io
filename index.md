# What

<img src="{{ site.logo }}" style="width:220px;vertical-align:middle;padding-right:30px;padding-bottom:10px;float:left">
A cross-disciplinary workshop, which aims to create a space for an honest and inclusive discussion about the harms and risks associated with the use of AI research advances for military applications and the associated AI arms race, challenges to regulate it, its implications on human rights, marginalized communities, global inequality, and global security; and strategies to regulate military AI to mitigate these harms and risks. We would like to bring together experts from the fields of AI, humanitarian disarmament, AI governance, social justice, human rights advocates, geopolitics and game theory of arms races, as well as people who are or were once involved in military applications of AI, to discuss together challenges, potential strategies and the role of AI researchers in AI demilitarization.

# When

December 2nd and December 3rd 2024.

# Where

In-person at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/) in Montreal,

**6666 Rue Saint-Urbain, Montr√©al, QC H2S 3H1** - Agora hall.

# Why

The growing interest of military agencies in adopting AI technologies raises concerns about the harms and risks posed by such AI applications with respect to safety, human rights, marginalized communities, conflict escalations and global security.  In this workshop, we aim to bridge the gap between the AI research community and experts in military AI regulations. Our workshop will foster a multidisciplinary discussion about the harms and risks related to the use of AI research advances for military applications. Invited speakers will introduce the audience to the topics of AI arms race, challenges in military AI regulations, implications on human rights and global inequality; as well as strategies for mitigating these risks.
