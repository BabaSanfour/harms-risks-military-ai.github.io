# Summary

<img src="{{ site.logo }}" style="width:240px;vertical-align:middle;padding-right:30px;padding-bottom:10px;float:left">

This workshop aims to bridge the gap between the AI research community and experts in military AI regulations. Given the growing  interest of military agencies in adopting AI technologies, we share raising concerns about associated harms and risks posed with respect to human rights and global security. Our goal is to promote an inclusive and multidisciplinary discussion on these challenging questions, working together to identify collective responses to them.
