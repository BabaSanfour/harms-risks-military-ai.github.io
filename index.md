# Summary

<img src="{{ site.logo }}" style="width:240px;vertical-align:middle;padding-right:30px;padding-bottom:10px;float:left">

This workshop aims to bridge the gap between the AI research community and experts in military AI regulations. Given the growing interest of military agencies in adopting AI technologies, we share raising concerns about associated harms and risks posed with respect to human rights and global security. Our goal is to promote an inclusive and multidisciplinary discussion on these challenging questions, working together to identify collective responses to them.

Invited speakers will introduce the audience to the topics of AI capabilities in the military, AI arms races and their risks, challenges in military AI regulations as well as humanitarian implications of emerging military technologies. Multifaceted panel discussions will bring together distinguished experts from the fields of AI, governance, humanitarian disarmament, game theory, as well as military experts to discuss together challenges, potential mitigation strategies, and the role of AI researchers in AI militarization and disarmament.

# Territorial acknowledgement

We, the organisers, acknowledge that the lands and waters where most of us live and where our universities are located---[Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/indigenouspeoples/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/circ/land-acknowledgement) and [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/indigenous/resources/territorial-acknowledgement.html)---are the traditional and unceded territories of Indigenous peoples. The Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) Nation call Tiohtiá:ke the site commonly known as Montréal. Since long before the arrival of European settlers, this territory has been and continues to be a gathering place for many Indigenous peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within our communities.
