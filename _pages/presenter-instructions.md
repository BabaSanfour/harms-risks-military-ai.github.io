# Poster instructions

Posters should be a maximum size of 48in (H) x 48in (W). Poster boards will be available from the beginning to the end of the workshop. We recommend having posters up throughout the workshop to allow attendees to browse them during breaks too.

Optional: You may also send us your poster as a pdf file to be posted on the workshop website, by email to `{{ site.email }}`. There is no deadline for this, but we recommend that you send us your poster at least one week before the workshop so it is available to attendees.

# Video recording instructions

Optional: You may send us a short video presentation (either directly or via a google drive link) to be posted on the workshop website, by email to `{{ site.email }}`. We recommend the video’s length to be approximately 5min. You can use whatever platform you want to record the video. One simple option is to record a zoom meeting of yourself, and sharing your screen to present slides. This is optional but highly recommended if you won’t be attending in person, and not giving a virtual contributed talk. There is no deadline for this, but we recommend that you send us your video at least one week before the workshop so it is available to attendees.
