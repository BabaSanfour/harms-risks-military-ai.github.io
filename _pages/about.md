The growing interest of military agencies in adopting AI technologies raises concerns about the harms and risks posed by such AI applications with respect to safety, human rights, marginalized communities, conflict escalations and global security.  In this workshop, we aim to bridge the gap between the AI research community and experts in military AI regulations. Our workshop will foster a multidisciplinary discussion about the harms and risks related to the use of AI research advances for military applications. Invited speakers will introduce the audience to the topics of AI arms race, challenges in military AI regulations, implications on human rights and global inequality; as well as strategies for mitigating these risks.

### Territorial acknowledgement

We, the organisers, acknowledge that the lands and waters where most of us live and where our universities are located---[Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/indigenouspeoples/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/circ/land-acknowledgement) and [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/indigenous/resources/territorial-acknowledgement.html)---are the traditional and unceded territories of Indigenous peoples. The Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) Nation call Tiohtiá:ke the site commonly known as Montréal. Since long before the arrival of European settlers, this territory has been and continues to be a gathering place for many Indigenous peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within our communities.
