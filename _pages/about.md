### Territorial acknowledgement

We, the organisers, acknowledge that the lands and waters where most of us live and where our universities are located---[Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/indigenouspeoples/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/circ/land-acknowledgement) and [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/indigenous/resources/territorial-acknowledgement.html)---is the traditional and unceded territory of Indigenous peoples. The Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) Nation call Tiohtiá:ke the site commonly known as Montréal. Since long before the arrival of European settlers, this territory has been and continues to be a gathering place for many Indigenous peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within our communities. 

### UNIQUE

[UNIQUE (Unifying Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence in Québec)](https://sites.google.com/view/unique-neuro-ai) is a research centre working at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence research. It consists of more than 80 researchers affiliated with several universities and research centres from different regions of the province, and even from outside of it. The main goal of UNIQUE is to promote and facilitate exchanges between research teams working at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience.

### USS

USS (UNIQUE Student Symposium) is a student-oriented, student-organized conference at the crossroads of neuroscience and AI research. The goal is to provide graduate students in those fields with an event tailor made to their needs and presenting the state of the art of what is done in neuro-AI research.

### USS 2021

Unfortunately, in the actual global circumstances, it is not possible to organize events for people to attend in person. However, this year's event will still take place, though in a virtual format. Both the keynote speakers and the workshop are going to be accessible through online platforms. Information and links will be provided following your registration.
