We welcome submissions regarding Harms and Risks of AI in the military, including but not limited to:

- Capabilities of AI systems used for military purposes and surveillance

- Analysis of the impacts of autonomous weapons systems in different regions across the world

- Ethical and philosophical perspectives on the military use of AI

- Impacts of military AI on human rights

- Effects of AI militarization on marginalized communities and global inequalities

- Implications of AI militarization on global security, arms races, escalation, and catastrophic risks

- Quantitative risk management frameworks for military AI

- Governance of AI in the military domain

- Political advocacy for disarmament of AI technologies

- AI disarmament strategies and initiatives

We will use the **double-blind** review process, with criteria including:
- Relevance
- Quality of the analysis presented
- For abstracts with empirical results, quality of the methodology and experiments
- Potential to lead to concrete and positive societal impacts

<!-- Authors of accepted abstracts are invited to present their work in the form of a poster during the workshop days or to submit a pre-recorded video -->

## Submission Format
Submitted abstracts are recommended to have at most **2 pages** with unlimited bibliography and appendix. Below are the LaTeX template files:

- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.tex">hraim_2024.tex</a> - LaTeX template
- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.sty">hraim_2024.sty</a> - LaTeX style file
- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.pdf">hraim_2024.pdf</a> - Example pdf file

The page limit is not hard, but keeping your abstract reasonably short and concise can greatly improve readability. Submissions must be **anonymous** by using the default `\usepackage{hraim_2024}` command provided in the LaTeX template file. Accepted abstracts will be hosted on this workshop website but are considered non-archival and can be submitted to other workshops, conferences or journals if their submission policy allows.  

## Dual Submission Policy
We allow dual submission with other workshops or conferences. You can also submit abstracts that have some overlaps with your recently published abstracts.
