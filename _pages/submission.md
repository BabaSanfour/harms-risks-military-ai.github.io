<!-- Authors of accepted papers are invited to present their work in the form of a poster during the workshop days or to submit a pre-recorded video -->

## Submission Format
Submitted papers are recommended to have at most **4 pages** with unlimited bibliography and appendix. Below are the LaTeX template files:

- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.tex">hraim_2024.tex</a> - LaTeX template
- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.sty">hraim_2024.sty</a> - LaTeX style file
- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.pdf">hraim_2024.pdf</a> - Example pdf file

The page limit is not hard, but keeping your paper reasonably short and concise can greatly improve readability. Submissions must be **anonymous** by using the default `\usepackage{hraim_2024}` command provided in the LaTeX template file. Accepted papers will be hosted on this workshop website but are considered non-archival and can be submitted to other workshops, conferences or journals if their submission policy allows.  

## Dual Submission Policy
We allow dual submission with other workshops or conferences. You can also submit papers that have some overlaps with your recently published papers.
