# Author and Submission Instructions
We invite you to submit extended abstracts for the opportunity to present a poster at the workshop. Extended abstracts can be about any **past or novel completed work, or ongoing work**. Submissions will be handled electronically via OpenReview. You will be asked to create an OpenReview account if you do not already have one. All submissions must be written in English. Authors of selected submissions will be invited to give a short talk.

OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:
 - New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks.
 - New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically.

<!-- Authors of accepted abstracts are invited to present their work in the form of a poster during the workshop days or to submit a pre-recorded video -->

## Submission Format
We recommend that submitted extended abstracts have **one page**. However, you are allowed to use up to a maximum of two pages. You are allowed to use an unlimited amount of space for bibliography and appendices. Below are the LaTeX template files:

- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.tex">hraim_2024.tex</a> - LaTeX template
- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.sty">hraim_2024.sty</a> - LaTeX style file
- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.pdf">hraim_2024.pdf</a> - Example pdf file

Submissions must be **anonymous** by using the default `\usepackage{hraim_2024}` command provided in the LaTeX template file. Reviews are double-blind: submissions revealing the authors’ identities will be automatically rejected. Accepted submissions are considered non-archival and can be submitted to other workshops, conferences or journals if their submission policy allows.  

For authors submitting using a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, please find below the instructions:

## Dual Submission Policy
We allow dual submission with other workshops or conferences. When citing your previous work, refrain from using ‘we’ or ‘our’. We accept posters presenting previously published materials (including pre-prints) but we ask you not to cite this material in your extended abstract to maintain anonymity during the reviewing period. We also ask you to omit acknowledgments in your submission.
