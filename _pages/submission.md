<!-- Authors of accepted abstracts are invited to present their work in the form of a poster during the workshop days or to submit a pre-recorded video -->

## Submission Format
Submitted abstracts should have at most **2 pages** with unlimited bibliography and appendix. Below are the LaTeX template files:

- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.tex">hraim_2024.tex</a> - LaTeX template
- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.sty">hraim_2024.sty</a> - LaTeX style file
- <a href="https://www.harms-risks-ai-military.org/assets/author_templates/hraim_2024.pdf">hraim_2024.pdf</a> - Example pdf file

Submissions must be **anonymous** by using the default `\usepackage{hraim_2024}` command provided in the LaTeX template file. Reviews are double-blind: submissions revealing the authors’ identities will be automatically rejected. Accepted abstracts will be hosted on this workshop website but are considered non-archival and can be submitted to other workshops, conferences or journals if their submission policy allows.  

## Dual Submission Policy
We allow dual submission with other workshops or conferences. You can also submit abstracts that have some overlaps with your recently published abstracts. When citing your previous work, refrain from using ‘we’ or ‘our’. We accept previously published material (including pre-prints) but we ask you not to cite this material to maintain anonymity during the reviewing period. We also ask you to omit acknowledgments in your submission.
