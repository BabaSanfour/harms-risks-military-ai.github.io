DESCRIPTION:Topic: Community rooted\, independent AI research\n\nThe Dis
 tributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR) was launched 
 in December 2021 by Timnit Gebru as a space for independent\, community-
 rooted AI research\, free from Big Techâ€™s pervasive influence. Gebru bel
 ieves that the harms embedded in AI technology are preventable and that 
 when its production and deployment include diverse perspectives and deli
 berate processes\, it can be put to work for people\, rather than agains
 t them. With DAIR\, Gebru aims to create an environment that is independ
 ent from the structures and systems that incentivize profit over ethics 
 and individual well-being. In this talk\, Gebru will discuss why she fou
 nded DAIR and what she hopes this interdisciplinary\, community-based\, 
 global network of AI researchers can accomplish. She will discuss the in
 centive structures that make it difficult to perform ethical AI research
 \, and give examples of how DAIR is hoping to forge a different path.\n\
 nBio\nTimnit Gebru is the founder and executive director of the Distribu
 ted Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR). Prior to that she
  was fired by Google in December 2020 for raising issues of discriminati
 on in the workplace\, where she was serving as co-lead of the Ethical AI
  research team. She received her PhD from Stanford University\, and did 
 a postdoc at Microsoft Research\, New York City in the FATE (Fairness Ac
 countability Transparency and Ethics in AI) group\, where she studied al
 gorithmic bias and the ethical implications underlying projects aiming t
 o gain insights from data. Timnit also co-founded Black in AI\, a nonpro
 fit that works to increase the presence\, inclusion\, visibility and hea
 lth of Black people in the field of AI\, and is on the board of AddisCod
 er\, a nonprofit dedicated to teaching algorithms and computer programmi
 ng to Ethiopian highschool students\, free of charge.\n\n----( Video Cal
