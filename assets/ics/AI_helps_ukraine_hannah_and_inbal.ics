DESCRIPTION:Topic: AI and Earth observations for global agricultural mon
 itoring and food security\n\nAbstract: Earth-observing satellites are co
 llecting terabytes of observations of the entire planet every day with u
 nprecedented clarity. These globally-available datasets offer immense op
 portunities for providing time-sensitive information needed by decision-
 makers about issues important to society\, such as agricultural producti
 on and food security. Analyzing these petabyte-scale Earth observation d
 atasets requires AI and machine learning methods designed to meet the un
 ique challenges and opportunities of Earth observation data. Harvest is 
 NASAâ€™s applied sciences program on agriculture and food security\, commi
 tted to advancing the use of satellite Earth observations to benefit foo
 d security and agriculture in the US and worldwide. In this talk\, Harve
 st Director Inbal Becker-Reshef and Harvest ML/AI Lead Hannah Kerner wil
 l talk about how Harvest is using AI and Earth observations to rapidly r
 espond to critical events impacting global agriculture and food security
 \, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
