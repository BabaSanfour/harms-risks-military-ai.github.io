DESCRIPTION:Topic: AI to explore molecular space and fight pandemics and
  climate change\n\nAbstract: \nMachine learning research is expanding it
 s reach\, beyond the traditional realm of the tech industry and into the
  activities of other scientists\, opening the door to truly transformati
 ve advances in these disciplines. In this lecture I will focus on two as
 pects\, modeling and experimental design\, that are intertwined in the t
 heory-experiment-analysis active learning loop that constitutes a core e
 lement of the scientific methodology. Computers will be necessary to go 
 beyond the currently purely manual research loop and take advantage of h
 igh-throughput experimental setups and large-scale experimental datasets
 . I will discuss methods related to active learning\, reinforcement lear
 ning\, generative modeling\, Bayesian ML\, amortized variational learnin
 g and causal discovery. I will discuss the notion of epistemic uncertain
 ty and how to estimate it. I will motivate generative policies that can 
 sample a diverse set of candidate solutions to a problem\, be it for pro
 posing new experiments or causal hypotheses. Finally\, I will describe c
 urrent research to help us with these questions based on a new deep lear
 ning probabilistic framework called GFlowNets and how we plan to apply t
 hese in areas of great societal need like the unmet challenge of antimic
 robial resistance or the discovery of new materials to help fight climat
 e change.\n\n----( Video Call )----\nhttps://www.crowdcast.io/c/ai-helps
