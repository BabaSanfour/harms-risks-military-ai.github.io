 span%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%0A%3C%2Fbody%3E":Title:Uncertainty-Aware Machine Learni
 ng for a Sustainable Food Supply Chain\n\nAbstract:\nIn the United States\,
  30–50% of all the food produced is wasted\, representing a\nmassive envi
 ronmental problem—food waste contributes to up to 25% of all\ngreenhouse 
 gas emissions. One of the main drivers of food waste is supply chain\nineff
 iciency. This talk describes (1) novel machine learning methods for\nreason
 ing under uncertainty and (2) their application to a real-world supply\ncha
 in control system that significantly improves efficiency and reduces waste.
 \nSpecifically\, I will present improved methods for calibrated uncertainty
 \nestimation and planning algorithms that benefit from accurate model\nunce
 rtainties. This research extends widely used uncertainty quantification\nme
 thods and demonstrates that most existing planning algorithms can be improv
 ed\nvia these methods. I will also describe how these algorithms are deploy
 ed in a\nreal-world supply chain control system. This system is currently d
 eployed across\nhundreds of supermarkets in the US (handling ~10% of US pro
 duce volume) and has\nled to waste reductions of up to 50%.\n\n---( Video C
