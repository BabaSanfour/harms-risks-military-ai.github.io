 0A%3C%2Fbody%3E":Title: Computational Psychology and Psychological Computat
 ion: How AI and Brain\nSciences can help each ether\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe rap
 idly developing field of computational psychology/psychiatry aims to\nbridg
 e the gap between the “legacy” approaches still prevalent in mental hea
 lth\ncare that rely on primarily subjective self-reports and subjective eva
 luations\nby doctors - in a stark contrast to other scientific and medical 
 fields where\nobjective tests (e.g. blood work\, X-ray\, MRI) are typically
  used to provide an\nobjective basis for diagnosis and prognosis. The promi
 se of computational\npsychiatry is to bring psychological diagnosis to a mo
 re solid ground based on\nobjective measurements\, potentially including br
 ain imaging\, wearable sensor\ndata\, as well as statistical analysis of sp
 eech and text data - the are where\nmodern AI techniques can prove highly u
 seful\, I will briefly mention some past\nand ongoing work by our group and
  collaborators in this directions\, from\ndeveloping more robust statistica
 l models across brain imaging datasets\, aiming\nat learning invariant feat
 ures of a mental state or a person across varying\nsetting\, to transferrin
 g knowledge extracted across different data modalities\,\nfollowing recent 
 advances in large-scale pretrained deep neural network models\nwhose transf
 er capabilities appear to go far beyond what was previously\nconsidered pos
 sible\,.However\, the road between AI and brain sciences is\nbidirectional:
  among many ways in which neuroscience\, psychiatry and psychology\ncan ins
 pire novel AI approaches\, the ability of an AI system to maintain\n“mean
 ingful” dialog with a person\, and reaching certain objectives of the dia
 log\n(e.g.\, application of AI in semi-automated therapy)\, can be consider
 ably\nimproved by importing certain practices and ideas from the therapeuti
 c dialog\ninto AI language models (I will briefly summarize our prior work 
 on depression\ntherapy dialogues). Finally\, given the rapid advances in th
 e capabilities of\nlarge scale models in the past 1-2 years\, sometimes cal
 led a “scaling\nrevolution” these days\, also increase the importance o
 f developing AI systems\nthat are aligned with human values and can avoid h
 arming humans while remaining\nuseful to them - the blossoming field of AI 
 Alignment (as a subfield of AI\nSafety\, which\, beyond alignment problem\,
  includes robustness and\ninterpretability of AI systems). The vast amount 
 of practical knowledge from the\nfields of psychology and neuroscience\, an
 d from psychiatric therapy practice\,\ncan be clearly very advancing the AI
  Alignment field.\n\n---( Video Call )----\\nhttps://www.crowdcast.io/c/ai-
