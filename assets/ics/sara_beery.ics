 %3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%0A%3C%2Fbody%3E":Title: Mapping urban trees across North Am
 erica with the Auto Arborist Dataset\n\nAbstract:\nGeneralization to novel 
 domains is a fundamental challenge for computer vision.\nNear-perfect accur
 acy on benchmarks is common\, but these models do not work as\nexpected whe
 n deployed outside of the training distribution. To build computer\nvision 
 systems that solve real-world problems at global scale\, we need\nbenchmark
 s that fully capture real-world complexity\, including geographic domain\ns
 hift\, long-tailed distributions\, and data noise. We propose urban forest\
 nmonitoring as an ideal testbed for studying and improving upon these compu
 ter\nvision challenges\, while working towards filling a crucial environmen
 tal and\nsocietal need. Urban forests provide significant benefits to urban
  societies.\nHowever\, planning and maintaining these forests is expensive.
  One particularly\ncostly aspect of urban forest management is monitoring t
 he existing trees in a\ncity: e.g.\, tracking tree locations\, species\, an
 d health. We introduce a new\nlarge-scale dataset that joins public tree ce
 nsuses from 23 cities with a large\ncollection of street level and aerial i
 magery\, containing over 2.5M trees and\n300 genera. This benchmark enables
  the exploration of automated urban forest\nmonitoring across modalities an
 d with respect to geographic distribution shifts\,\nvital for such a system
  to be deployed at-scale.\n\n---( Video Call )----\\nhttps://www.crowdcast.
